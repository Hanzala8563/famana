If the user wants to take recommendations randomly, the basic recommender system function runs. The recommender system evaluates movies in the data based on IMDB weighted rating function and takes the top 30 of them. After that tells one of them randomly.

Another option is user gives a movie example to the assistant and takes it as a reference for the new movie recommendation.
